2.3-1
	Reimplemented the used functionality of and removed the dependence
	on mclust.

	Fixed a number of bugs reported by Nicola Sorani.

	Modified the proposal tuner to propose those variables with high
	autocorrelation more aggressively (at the expense of the
	others). This should vastly improve mixing for complex models.

2.3
	Added an ability to fit bilinear latent space models of
	Hoff (2005).

	Bug fixes, including one reported by Soriani Nicola.

	Documentation fixes.

2.2-3
	Fixed a bug in handling of missing data, uncovered by Xiaoyue
	"Maggie" Niu, and added a test for it.

	Documentation fixes.

2.2-2
	More documentation fixes.

2.2-1
	Documentation fixes.

2.2
	Ability to fit random effects (actor heterogeneity) models.

	Removed ergmm.par class --- it has been rendered obsolete by
	changes in R's handling of partial matching in [[ operator.

	Many bug fixes and miscellaneous changes.
