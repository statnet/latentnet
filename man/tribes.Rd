\title{Read Highland Tribes}
\format{
An undirected \code{\link[network]{network}} object with no loops, having the following attributes:
 \describe{
   \item{\code{\%v\% "vertex.names"}}{Character attribute with names of tribes.}
   \item{\code{\%e\% "pos"}}{Logical attribute indicating an
     alliance relationship.}
   \item{\code{\%e\% "neg"}}{Logical attribute indicating a hostile
     relationship ("rova").}
   \item{\code{\%e\% "sign"}}{Numeric attribute coding -1 for enmity, 0
     for no relationship, and 1 for alliance.}
   \item{\code{\%e\% "sign.012"}}{Numeric attribute coding 0 for enmity, 1
     for no relationship, and 2 for alliance.}
 }
 Because of limitations of \code{\link[network]{network}} objects, the object
 itself is a complete graph, and is thus meaningless if used directly
 or plotted.
